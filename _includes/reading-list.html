<h2>Reading List</h2>
<p>
    Here are the books that I have read. Some of them I recommend for you to read as well if you are interested, others I don't ;) </br>
    
    A highly recommended book doesn't mean that I like everything about the book or even agree with all the things in it. 
    But I am simply saying that the perspective is worth a listen. 

    It's an incomplete list at the moment. 
    
    The books are in a rough recommendation order. Not an exact ranking but I will add that soon enough.
